Some 1wt clocks that can be configured to output different numbers of pulses. These can for example be used as 27 pulse clocks.
## Variants
- Top activated (both even- and odd-n outputs)
- Top activated with comparator output for reset (only odd-n output)
- Bottom activated (only odd-n output)
- Side activated (only even-n output)
## Features
- 1 Wide tileable
- Can be adjusted to many different pulse outputs
## Considerations
- You need to wait until the hopper is empty before re-activating the clock
