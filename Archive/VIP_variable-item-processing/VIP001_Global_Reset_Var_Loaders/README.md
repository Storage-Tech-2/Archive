Automatically sets filters based on what items come to each slice first, and loads them into single-type boxes. All filters are simultaneously reset when item stream stops.

## Features
- Butterfly tiled (2 wide tileable slices with 2 filters in each)
- Ejects partial boxes on reset
- Burns items when boxes are low
- Fullspeed breaking prevents backups in the loader
- Failed boxplacements due to unloading are fixed on reset
- Loaders can also be reset while items come in

## Notes
Filters are setup with 0-19-1-1-1 dummy items in the filter hoppers.
