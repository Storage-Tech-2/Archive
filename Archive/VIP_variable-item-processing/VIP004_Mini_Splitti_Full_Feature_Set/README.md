Takes in mixed boxes and splits them into boxes containing a single item type. Uses dueling hoppers splitter technique.

## Features
- 90% hopper locked (a total of 5 unlocked hoppers out of 50 total)
- Small size! 12x6x16 (LWH)
- Emptied Boxes and Unstackables are output in separate streams from Partials output.
- Pauseable with global clock

## Considerations
- Does not handle Empty box inputs (Please don't send empty boxes to splitters in the first place!)

## Notes
Press stone button to start splitting after putting in boxes. Empty box input hopper is covered by wool for hopperNoItemCost carpet rule but can be replaced with more chest storage.
