An input interface built into a corner. Uses hoppercarts to unload chests rapidly.

## Features
- Included manual loader display box for loose items, which replaces box if the box has items and is closed.
- Chest contents are unloaded as item entities rapidly using hoppercarts.
- Chest inputs are not unloaded until noteblock is pressed.
- Pause line stops unloading of chests and locks box display

## Considerations
- If box display is filled while pause line is activated, box must be opened/closed again to replace it when pause is lifted.
