High throughput whitelister. Can support 360k/hr for 6 item types (must be different item types), 144k/hr for 3 items types (these 3 slots could all be the same if you want though), and 72k/hr for 4 item types. The 6 item types are single item carts, the 3 item types are present in 2 mixed carts, the 4 item types alternate in sets of 2 between the 2 mixed carts.
## Features
- Very high throughput filtering selecting multiple item types
- The schematic contains an item layout for bartering.
## Notes
This specific schem hasn't been tested, but the design itself has been tested for many hours with random input, so if there is a bug there is a working version somewhere. This is intended to be paired with a redcoded array so that the 6 item types don't need filtered loaders.
