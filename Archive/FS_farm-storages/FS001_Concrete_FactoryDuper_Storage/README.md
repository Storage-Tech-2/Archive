A common question is "how to make concrete storage?" This was put together as a basic concrete storage, configured for a 192k duper. It has ~1.2mil capacity for 34 item types + some overflow.
## Features
- Configured for a 192k duper
- Uses global reset var loaders
- 1.2mil capacity for 34 item types
- Some overflow storage
## Considerations
- Destroys partial boxes resulting from resetting variable loaders.
