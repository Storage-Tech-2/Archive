A large bulk storage designed to handle the new platform based concrete factories in 1.21+
## Features
- 1.21+
- 1.7m per item
- Concrete & powder mode, flint & gravel
- Input protection, handles any items accidentally thrown on the platform while the farm is inactive
- Partial Box recycling
## Considerations
- Box crafting logic can be improved but works perfectly fine
- Not fully hopper locked but this is a non issue with lithium
- Uses box displays, this would be a pro or a con depending on user preference
- Directional
## Notes
- Tested for 200+ hours without issues.
- Dupe 1 color at a time and wait for the partial boxes to be ejected from the var loader before starting up the farm again (could technically dupe up to 5 at a time but try to avoid).
- Directional
