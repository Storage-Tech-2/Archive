A collection of various circuits that automatically drop all received items as entities. The blue designs on the left are 2x hopper speed and the ones on the right are 1x.
## Features
- All designs except C3 and D3 are unbreakable with random input
## Considerations
- The piston in C3 will clock when receiving items and power the dropper twice as often then needed
- C3 and D3 may break if they are powered externally or if they receive items at greater than 1x speed
