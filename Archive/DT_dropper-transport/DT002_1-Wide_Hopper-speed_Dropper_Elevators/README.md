## Notes
A3 by @rapscallion1138
B2 by Minestop
D1/2 by @andrews54757 
compiled by @walter7381 

-  D1/2 (Green) is non tillable but transfers items instantly and is silent. Doesn't work when rails are facing towards the positive X direction (east) .
-  "Unstackables noisy" mean that the design is normally silent however, unstackable items may cause clicking noises in adjacent slices.
-  C1 is 1.13+ and is very noisy
- All design not labelled silent have clicking along the tower after items are done passing through, otherwise they are silent. (Excluding C1)
