A small display without empty box collection that breaks the box only when empty and closed.
## Features
- Small (6x6)
- Smart box breaking, only breaks it when empty and closed
- Global first box placement
- Minimum hoppers, fully locked
## Considerations
- When triggering while the display is replacing a box, the global first box placement can cause it to break a newly dispensed full box
- No empty box collection
- When emptying adjacent slices in very quick succession, one of them may fail to replace its box
- Buffers a box
