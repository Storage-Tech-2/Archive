0-ticks powder snow into the box when emptied, allowing for a fully reliable hopperless collection.
## Features
- Clean UI; box and chest are only separated by the display block
- Bufferless; all boxes are accessible to the player
- Comparator readout from the chest
- Global first box placement
- Reliable, hopperless collection of empty boxes into a water stream
- Relatively small (9x9)
## Considerations

## Notes
May fail to reliably collect a box if adjacent slices activate in quick succession, this is very very rare though. A schematic of a tiled example with global first box dispensing and the water stream set up can be found in the thread.
