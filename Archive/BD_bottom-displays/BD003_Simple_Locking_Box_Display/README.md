# Simple Locking Box Display

An incredibly simple box display that is quick to build and is the only 4 wide box display to my knowledge.

## Considerations
- One Wide AB Tileable (alternate slime and honey)
- You canâ€™t easily handle initial box detection.
- It should be possible to time the breaking on another slice to cause the box breaking to trigger extra and break a partial full box, but this is so incredibly unlikely.
