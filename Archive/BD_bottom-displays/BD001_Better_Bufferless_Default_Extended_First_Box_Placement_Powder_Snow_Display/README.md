0-ticks powder snow into the box when emptied, allowing for a fully reliable hopperless collection. Additionally, the snow is in front of the dispenser when no box is placed making the dispenser not visible.

## Features
- Clean UI; box and chest are only separated by the display block; default extended snow when no box is placed
- Bufferless; all boxes are accessible to the player
- Comparator readout from the chest
- Initial first box placement
- Reliable, hopperless collection of empty boxes into a water stream
- Small (9x10 width)

## Considerations
- Can break if the chest is emptied during box replacement or initial placement
- May fail to reliably collect a box if adjacent slices activate in quick succession, this is very very rare though
