Filters items, crafts, and loads the result into boxes. Typically used to compact items (eg nuggets) so they take up less space. Can be used for recipes with 8 or 9 items.

## Features
- It uses an SSI filter with minimal Threshold and Prefill.
- These crafters only start crafting when they detect a completely full SS9 crafter.
- The system uses a global SS11 line to control the crafters.
- It can empty an overflowing crafter that has stopped by pulsing an SS15 signal.
- You can point up to 6 slices (24x Hs into a single box loader)

## Considerations
- Loaders have a very low chance (1 in 50 million) of losing a box.
