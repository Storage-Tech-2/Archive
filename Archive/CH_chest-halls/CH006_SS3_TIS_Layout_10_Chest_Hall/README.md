10 chests per slice hall using the TIS layout, but with SS3 filters

## Features
- Slices are identical, locking system is the only change between slices
- 0 prefilled hopper/dispenser
- Runs at hopperspeed
- Fully hopper-locked (36 hoppers/Slice)

## Considerations
- TIS layout requires 2 transparent block displays per slice
- Brief clicking noise in the bottom droppers after they are done elevating items
- Bottom filters are only accessible through the locking system after removing the display blocks (from the inside)
