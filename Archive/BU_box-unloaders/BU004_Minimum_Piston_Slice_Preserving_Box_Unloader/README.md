Unloads items from boxes at hopperspeed.
## Features
- Empty boxes are collected instantly and are unable to land in other slices, avoiding output contamination.
- Boxes are separated reliably and dropped out of the bottom, while unloaded items go in the chest.
- Very easy to hopper lock
- Solid state & togglestateless, improving robustness.
## Considerations
- Does not handle empty boxes
- No initial box placement due to possible issue with random input
