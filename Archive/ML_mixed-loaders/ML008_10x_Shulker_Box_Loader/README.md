A proof of concept (read: not recommended for real systems) high-speed shulker box loader that operates at 10x hopper speed by breaking the box using duped TNT.
## Features
- Loads boxes at 10x hopper speed
- Utilizes explosions traveling through corner gaps between diagonal blocks for obsidian shielding
- TNT raised on water-logged fence/wall to avoid hitting the top dropper
- Shulker box protects the bottom dropper from blast damage
- Two versions: one activates TNT only when the box is filled (slower box swapping), the main one pre-emptively launches TNT and blocks sight to the box until needed
## Considerations
- Uses TNT to break the boxes
- Effective loading speed is 9.8x due to waiting for backlog detection and TNT breaking
