Loads mixed items into boxes at full hopperspeed. Meant for use in input systems to prevent the case where items can back up into the item/box checker if the input receives a constant stream of items.
## Features
- 5x5x4 size
- Does not break with random input due to locking the dropper before box replacement
- Clocks droppers at 8gt during normal operation and 4gt to clear backup to maintain full 1x hopper speed
- Automatically breaks box after a period of no input
