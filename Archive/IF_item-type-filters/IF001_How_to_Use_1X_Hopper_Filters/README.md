The top-most hopper will only suck items that have a certain item type at hopperspeed (1 item/8gt or 2.5 items/sec). Two variants are common: Signal Strength 2 (SS2) and Signal Strength 3 (SS3) filters.

## Features
- Basic designs with inventory setup guide

## Considerations
- SS2 filter is not 1 wide tileable, you must A/B tile
