Sorts potions by their potion contents using comparator update detectors. Works by trying to brew a potion with a set ingredient.

## Features
- Hopperspeed and 2 wide (not tileable).
- Consumes 1 blaze powder every 20 sorted potions.
- Includes V2 which is smaller but is globally clocked (pulse 2 tick repeater)

## Considerations
- Not tileable
- Cannot differentiate between all potion types

## Notes
Put an ingredient item in the brewer to set what type(s) you want to filter. It's not consumed during filtering. [Showcase Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b2GOj19gPY)
