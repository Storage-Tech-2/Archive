The smallest device to sort between two potion types, books, water bucket, snow bucket, lava bucket, shears, and flint and steel.

## Features
- Sorts 8 unstackable item types: two potion types, books, water bucket, snow bucket, lava bucket, shears, and flint and steel
- combination of local and global clocks ensure sections are activated when needed.
- very very small (5x5x10). 25 hoppers total.
- really clean outputs, all are one next to another in a straight line down the center

## Considerations
- Not hopperlocked

## Notes
- TODO: Add entity section to sort discs, carts and their 5 types, boats and their 2 types, armor, netherrite
