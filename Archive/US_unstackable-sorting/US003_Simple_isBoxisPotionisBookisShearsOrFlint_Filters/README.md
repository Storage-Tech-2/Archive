These filters can accept any unstackable item as input and depending on the inventory block check if they are either a box, a potion, a book, or are shears/flint at hopperspeed.

## Features
- Very simple hopperspeed design
- Can accept any obtainable unstackable item as input

## Notes
The isShearsOrFlint filter uses a dispenser. Be careful not to input stackable TNT by accident.
