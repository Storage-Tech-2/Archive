The smallest device to sort between two potion types, books, shears, flint and steel, lava bucket, water bucket, snow bucket, carts, boats, and music discs.
## Features
- Sorts 11 unstackable item types: two potion types, books, shears, flint and steel, lava bucket, water bucket, snow bucket, carts, boats, and music discs.
- Hopperspeed using combination of local and global clocks
- Very very small (12x5x5). 29 hoppers total.
- Really clean outputs, all are one next to another in a straight line down the center
- Random input timings proof
## Considerations
- Not hopperlocked
- Does not sort between cart variants, boat variants, or armor.
- Music disc sorter has an idle cart, but there is enough space to add mechanism to remove it.
- Not fish preserving. Use a separate fish emptying device if you plan on putting your pets in here. Or you can use the included fish preserving variant that is 1 block taller and uses 33 hoppers.
