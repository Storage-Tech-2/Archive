## Features
- Hopper speed: up to 9000 items per hour can be sorted.
- Compact: 6x11x16.
- Fish, axolotls and tadpoles from water buckets get placed inside a cage.
- All of the clocks are independent, in order to minimize the lag produced.
- Fully hopperlocked variant included
## Notes
- Do not input stackable items and shulker boxes.
- The armor filter requires a supply of any kind of arrows.
- All the litematics include the contents of the containers that must be prefilled.
- The unsorted output can be moved elsewhere by redirecting the water stream leading into it.
