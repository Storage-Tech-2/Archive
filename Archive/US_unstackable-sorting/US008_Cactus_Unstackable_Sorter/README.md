Sorts 10 types of unstackable items (music discs, enchanted books, potions, flint & steel, shears, water buckets, lava buckets, powder snow buckets, boats, minecarts)
## Features
- Very compact; 5x7x13
- Processes 1 item every 16gt
- Fully hopper locked with no idle carts while locked.
## Considerations
- Many clocks are connected, leading to some unnecessary lag while running.
## Notes
- Schematic has both normal and hopper locked versions as subregions.
- Winner of the 2025 Unstackable Sorter Contest!
## Compatibility
1.20+
## Instructions
1. If you are dropping item entities in the input directly, make sure that item entities cannot land in the input hopper, or items may self-insert at the wrong timings. This can be done by placing a slab over the input hopper to cover the opening.
