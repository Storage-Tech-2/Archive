Placement of a boat to quickly float align other entities by colliding with the boat.
This is a simpler alternative to [TT001](../../../Archive/TT_tricks-and-tips/TT001_How_to_float_align_items)

### What is "Float Align"?

> The minecart hitbox is 0.98 blocks. When a piston retracts with an entity inside, it push it by 0.020000009536746 block to the opposite direction, if there is no blocks in front. So one side [of the mincart] is slightly on the next block.
> 
> Easiest way to float a minecart is 0 ticking a piston with the minecart in front.
> 
> This cause the minecart to be detectable by block, but the entity doesn't collide with the blocks.
> 
> A few examples of blocks that can detect the minecart:
> moving blocks can push the minecart, slimeblock can accelerate it 
> hopper can interact with minecarts inventories
> tripwire detect it when ticked, but the minecart doesn't tick it(you can put an entity colliding with the block where the tripwire is to tick it continuously)
