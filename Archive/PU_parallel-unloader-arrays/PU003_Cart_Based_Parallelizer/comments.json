    "content": "**Cart Based Paralleliser Explanation**\nBy: _javierrubik33\nLogic:\n\n__Input:__\nSystem starts by spawning a cart that has its first 4 slots filled with unstackables to then pass it under the input item pile, thus allowing the cart to pick up a single stackÂ  whether it is a regular item, an unstackable or a shulker box. After that, 4 unstackables are removed from the cart.\n\n__2 Item Check:__\nLater a 2 item check (that will be necessary for later steps) is performed, it works by removing 1 item with a hopper, and then detect the cart with detector rail + comparator. That pulse is later used to redirect the cart to one way or another. After the detection is done the item previously removed is returned to the cart.**1** If cart had only a single item it is rerouted to a presorter, which will separate boxes, unstackables and single items, each to its respective output.**2**\n\n__Note 1:__ In between that step one item is taken from the cart and put right back, with the objective to get the cart performed the following way [2 0 0 0 62] to allow later processing.\n__Note 2:__ Since input is being taken with full carts it means that if a single item has been found it is the last of its type, thus allowing direct output without danger of overflow.",
