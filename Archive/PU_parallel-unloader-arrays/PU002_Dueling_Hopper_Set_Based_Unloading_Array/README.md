This contraption in meant to speed up your sorting process by unloading multiple boxes simultaneously. It uses a small list (set) that knows which items are being unloaded and therefore knows which not to unload in order not to surpass the hopper speed threshold.

## Features
- Fully Hopper Locked
- 16 slices with a maximum unloading speed of 144000 items/h
- Pause mode which stops the unloader completely in less than 30s *(idk if this number is right) *
- Stack size dependent batching system (originally introduced by <@164989359148367873>) for ss2, which stacks 64 stackable to 41 and 16 stackable 13/14. Regular batching system for ss3 version which stacks all items to 5.
- Small footprint (26x17x13)
- 20gt global clock
- Dueling hoppers instead of filters to reduce filter items usage in unloading array
