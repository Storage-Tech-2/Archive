This machine takes any shulker boxes as an input, and unloads them, several at a time, so that stackable items are never unloaded faster than 9000 items per hour, which is the maximum a 1 times hopper speed filter can handle. By unloading several different item types at the same time, when attached to a filter based storage this machine can help sort items at extremely high speed; up to 144000 items per hour, or 16 times hopper speed.
## Features
- Up to 16x hopperspeed parallelization
- Uses an item type set to ensure only hopperspeed output per type at a time
## Notes
- Testing info, FAQ, instructions on how to adjust the system to output for signal strength 3 filters, and more in the [Manual](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wURZLtZx3b3m7RmgFqyuDXkxZ8FbK9xeMSmTxDZ_1F8>). Thanks to Passionate Storage Techer 69 and Raffq for advice on testing.
