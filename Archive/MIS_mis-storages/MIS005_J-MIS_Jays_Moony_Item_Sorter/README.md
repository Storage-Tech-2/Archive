A compact MIS system using MIS 5.1 and hybrid box loaders, acting as bulk (97k capacity per bulk item, with overflow protection).
## Features
- Input full boxes and loose items in the same place
- 896 Hoppers, 75% Hopperlocked
- Compact system (29x29x35), fits under a single chunk loader with no chunk alignment.
- Included item layout which sorts all items.
- Runs at hopper speed, with a gap between item types
- Includes feature to distribute boxes after building.
- Box loaders are callable, allowing all items to be accessible at any time.
- Includes an MIS fix mode, which locks hoppers in the mis and manually buffer droppers, (video will include a tutorial).
- Overflow and empty box detection.
- Pause feature, USE WELL BEFORE LOGGING OFF!!!
## Considerations
- No box sorting, all boxes input are unloaded, and if bulk, repacked into boxes.
- Pause feature is rather slow.
- While all automatic systems are toggle-stateless, the box-call feature has a brief couple toggle-states for compactness.
## Notes
WDL Includes (from left to right) an unassigned build (no filters), an assigned build (with filters), and an undecorated, unfiltered build, plus the item layout and slice behind.
