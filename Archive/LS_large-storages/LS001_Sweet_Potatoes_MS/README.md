A fairly large storage system that utilizes a parallel unloading array allowing the system to unload at a max of 8x hopper speed.

## Features
- ~90% Hopperlocked
- Has various peripherals: restock stations, furnace array, crafting station, and yeeting station, masscrafter, brewer, and unstackable sorter
- Has a concrete duper in the middle of the storage (This was requested, can easily be omitted in the building process)
- Has a big bulk with capacity for ~1.3m / item.
- Has 1 DC capacity chest halls with SS2 filters.
- Uses MIS 5.1

## Considerations
- This system requires you to have Carpet's `stackableShulkerBoxes` rule enabled and subsequently Kikugie's StackableShulkerFix.

## Notes
Tested for ~400k items without issues
