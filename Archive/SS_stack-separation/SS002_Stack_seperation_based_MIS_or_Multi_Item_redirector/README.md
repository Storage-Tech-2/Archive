Sorts item entity stacks to different block positions if they have an item contained in a corresponding set. Designed to be attached to end of storage and not be a bottleneck. Sorts item as entity, so you can redirect every mis category to go anywhere with water stream or shorten the lifetime of items searching for the correct filter by redirecting it to the correct ice stream and giving it an optimal route to reduce search times.

## Features
- 96% Hopperlocked (some locally and other by 2 global lines.
- Sorts up to a stack roughly every 5 sec. (Can be improved slightly)
- Larger stack of items always land at exactly same spot
- 16 Slices (Can be adjusted, not straight forward).
- Not directional or locational.
- No toggle states
- Dry fire proof up to 64 times (item blockers run out).
- Can handle unstackables, they go straight through to unsorted.

## Considerations
- Tested a bunch, but not for extensive amounts (idk how tbh)
- Curved rails
- Target blocks are included
