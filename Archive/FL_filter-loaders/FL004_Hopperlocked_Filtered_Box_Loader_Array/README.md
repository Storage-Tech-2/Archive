This filtered shulker box array is fully hopperlocked and uses only 4 hoppers in each slice.
## Features
- Fully hopperlocked
- Low hopper count: 4 hoppers/slice
- 9x9 Size
- Signal strength independent filters
- Water collection
- Can be stacked vertically (128x hopperspeed 2x2 layout schematic included)
## Considerations
- While there is a 1x loader every 1 wide slice, you need to AB tile 2 wide slices containing 2 loaders at a time.
- Waterstream box distribution is required
- Waterstream requires gaps in ice for hopperlocking
## Notes
- The base schematic contains a 32x hopperspeed capacity.
- Empty boxes dispensing is triggered when a full box is output with a 1:1 ratio. If you run out of boxes, you will have to manually dump in empty boxes in the box distribution stream to refill the loaders. Global call based distribution coming soon:tm:

## Instructions
1. Setup hopper filters
2. Unlock loaders by flicking the hopperlocking lever on red concrete block at the bottom corner of the device
3. Dump item entities into input
4. Relock loaders only after everything has been loaded into boxes. Engaging locking while loader is active may cause box replacement to fail.
