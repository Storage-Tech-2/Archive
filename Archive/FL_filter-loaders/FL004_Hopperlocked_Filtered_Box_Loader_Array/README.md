This filtered shulker box array is fully hopperlocked and uses only 4 hoppers in each slice.
## Features
- Fully hopperlocked
- Low hopper count: 4 hoppers/slice
- 9x9 Size
- Signal strength independent filters
- Water collection
- Can be stacked vertically (128x hopperspeed 2x2 layout schematic included)
## Considerations
- While there is a 1x loader every 1 wide slice, you need to AB tile 2 wide slices containing 2 loaders at a time.
- Waterstream box distribution is required
- Waterstream requires gaps in ice for hopperlocking
## Notes
- The base schematic contains a 32x hopperspeed capacity.
- Empty boxes dispensing is triggered when a full box is output with a 1:1 ratio. If you run out of boxes, you will have to manually dump in empty boxes in the box distribution stream to refill the loaders. Global call based distribution coming soon:tm:

## Instructions
- Setup hopper filters
- Unlock loaders by flicking the hopperlocking lever on red concrete block at the bottom corner of the device
- Dump item entities into input
- Relock loaders only after everything has been loaded into boxes. Engaging locking while loader is active may cause box replacement to fail.
