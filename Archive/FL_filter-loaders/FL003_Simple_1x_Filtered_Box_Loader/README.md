Togglestate-less and simple device that filters and loads items into shulker boxes at hopperspeed.
## Features
- Includes an SS3 item filter. 7x7 in size.
- Togglestate-less
## Considerations
- Can very rarely lose a box (~1 in 100 million boxes) when multiple slices trigger at timely intervals.
## Notes
Two schematics are provided; one for 1.11+ that's one block higher and one for 1.13+ with two alternative ways to wire the box breaking. Both share the same features.
