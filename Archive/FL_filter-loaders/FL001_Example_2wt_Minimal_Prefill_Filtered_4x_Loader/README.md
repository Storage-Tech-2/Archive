Filters then loads items into boxes at 4x hopperspeed. Only requires prefilling a single hopper under each filter with a stack of the sorted item. Uses 2x filters that sync with hopper cooldown better than most high speed loaders. Two versions using different filters are provided: SS3 (2wABt) and SSI.

## Features
- No item spitting with random input
- Relatively small footprint (SS3: 6x9x2; SSI: 7x10x2)
- Minimal prefilling needed when setting up, only 64+1 of the desired item. Prefill [like so](https://discord.com/channels/748542142347083868/869352287708012634/869591141065039962).

## Considerations
- An empty box needs to be put into the dispenser when first setting up

## Notes
You can find a different design suited for larger quantities of items in the thread.

**Double 2wt Minimal Prefill Filtered 4x Loader**

Two loaders right next to each other, allowing items to flow over the hoppers of both simultaneously, reducing item lifetime. Same setup procedure as above. Quickly stops an adjacent slice's clock when replacing a box, but this doesn't greatly affect loading speed.
