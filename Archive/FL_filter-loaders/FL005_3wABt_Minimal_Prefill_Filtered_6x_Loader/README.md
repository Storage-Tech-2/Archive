Filters then loads items into boxes at 6x hopperspeed. Only requires prefilling a single hopper under each filter with a stack of the sorted item. Uses conventional 2x filters that sync with hopper cooldown better than most high speed loaders.
## Features
- 3 wide AB tileable, schematic includes both tiles as subregions
- No item spitting with random input
- Relatively small footprint (9x7x3)
- Ejects full boxes as items without buffer (can be removed)
## Notes
Noisy and silent variants included. Each schematic has hopper locked and SSI filter versions.
