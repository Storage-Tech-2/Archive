Separates boxes based on if the first item of the input box matches an item set.

## Features
- Output can be adjusted. For example: moving the gate to a different distance, replacing the gate with a piston setup (the gate cannot be replaced by a trapdoor at the distance shown), or by locking or unlocking a hopper to separate the box.
- Can be expanded or made smaller, however the 8 slice version presented is the only one I tested. If hopper separation is used, additional testing should be minimal.
- 50-53 items per slice can be sorted, depending on how many 16 stackables there are in the chest.

## Considerations
- If an item or empty box is input, the output will spit out a hopper minecart. If enough hopper carts are spit out, it will break.

## Notes
- The chest should be configured to have 55 dummy 64 stackables and 3 unstackables. To add an item to the black/whitelist, remove 1 stackable item, or 4 if the item being added is a 16 stackable, then add ***only*** 1 of the listed item into the chest.
- Add an item ***only*** to 1 chest.
- The signal strength of the comparators reading from the chests should be 2 then change to 1 when one item is removed from the chest.
