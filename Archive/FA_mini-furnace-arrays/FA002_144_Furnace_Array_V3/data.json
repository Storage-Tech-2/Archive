    "description": "144 Furnace array that provides and input and output of shulker boxes in a relatively small form factor. It Provides two modes, Full send mode which is useful for a lot of boxes with the same item type that needs to be smelted. The second mode is a box preservation mode that maintains the content of the shulker box if you are doing boxes with separate item types(this one is roughly ~25% slower assuming full boxes)",
    "features": [
      "10x12x46",
      "Fully hopperlocked (458 total hoppers)",
      "optional box content preservation",
      "max Speed of just below 6x Hopper speed",
      "Togglestate-less",
      "Protection against running out of fuel(Reads extra boxes)"
    ],
    "considerations": [
      "A few flashing dust",
      "Single Minecart Entity",
      "Burns Fuel box(this can be switch easily to a water stream)",
      "Rail placements are kinda sus",
      "Chunk loading line briefly turns off on box preservation mode(for like 3 seconds between item types)",
      "There is no protection against switching between modes when going through the pause sequence and then resuming"
    ],
    "notes": "- The Array only supports fuel that can burn 8 or more items(coal, charcoal, blaze rods)\n- Schematic was taken and the system was tested in 1.19.4\n- This is meant to be a remote furnace array so there is no Good UI for it\n- The honey Can be replaced with slime blocks for the rising edges and an ender chest for the Box loader\n- Tested for only 2 million items in each mode\nthis Post is long af lmao"
