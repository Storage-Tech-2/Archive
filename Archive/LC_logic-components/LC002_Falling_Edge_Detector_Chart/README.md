A handful of compact, 1-wide tileable (1wt) falling edge detectors, which are redstone circuits designed to output a brief pulse when an input signal transitions from on to off.
## Features
- 1-wide design for space efficiency
- Tileable, allowing multiple units to be placed side-by-side
- Detects falling edges in redstone signals, useful for timing and automation
## Considerations
- Requires understanding of redstone mechanics
- Some designs may vary in speed or reliability based on components used
## Notes
These are commonly used in Minecraft redstone engineering for creating precise timing circuits.
## Compatibility
Compatible with Minecraft Java Edition versions 1.11 and later (where observers are available); similar concepts work in Bedrock Edition with adjustments.
## Instructions
1. One simple design: Place an observer facing the input signal.
2. Connect the observer's output to a repeater or comparator to create the pulse.
3. For a piston-based version: Use a sticky piston with a block and redstone torch to detect the edge.
4. Test the circuit to ensure it triggers only on falling edges.
