Loads items at 6x hopper speed into shulker boxes on a global clock. This has the advantage of being more lag friendly and smaller than similar locally clocked loaders.
## Features
- Loads items at 6x hopper speed
- Very small (4x6x3 per module)
- Globally clocked droppers
- Schematic contains some tiling examples
## Considerations
- No item filter included
