Designed for quad bulks with more available space under the top display.
## Features
- Nice top UI
- Locally locked minimum hopper locking
- Global first box placement
## Considerations
- Requires more space under the display compared to https://discord.com/channels/748542142347083868/749137152192806954/1085199265992802485 (in [Storage Tech](https://discord.gg/JufJ6uf))
- Initial placement has many piston actions
## Notes
- Older versions may need more than two slices in order to avoid toggling the sticky during the initial place.
