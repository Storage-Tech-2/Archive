Breaks the box with a piston that drops down from the top. Mainly meant for quad bulks.
## Features
- Automatic box replacement when emptied
- Drop-down layout gives more space below for a secondary bottom display
- Full hopperlocking is possible
## Considerations
- Hopperlocking dust line must be disabled globally within 20 gt of a box being emptied.  May require gaps to extend redstone line.
## Notes
Make sure dust line is redirected as shown in the picture to not power the piston. For 1.11+ compatibility replace the glass with slabs/solid blocks and noteblocks with trapdoors/rails.
