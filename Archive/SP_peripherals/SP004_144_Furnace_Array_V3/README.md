144 Furnace array that provides and input and output of shulker boxes in a relatively small form factor. It Provides two modes, Full send mode which is useful for a lot of boxes with the same item type that needs to be smelted. The second mode is a box preservation mode that maintains the content of the shulker box if you are doing boxes with separate item types(this one is roughly ~25% slower assuming full boxes)
## Features
- 10x12x46
- Fully hopperlocked (458 total hoppers)
- optional box content preservation
- max Speed of just below 6x Hopper speed
- Togglestate-less
- Protection against running out of fuel(Reads extra boxes)
## Considerations
- A few flashing dust
- Single Minecart Entity
- Burns Fuel box(this can be switch easily to a water stream)
- Rail placements are kinda sus
- Chunk loading line briefly turns off on box preservation mode(for like 3 seconds between item types)
- There is no protection against switching between modes when going through the pause sequence and then resuming
## Notes
- The Array only supports fuel that can burn 8 or more items(coal, charcoal, blaze rods)
- Schematic was taken and the system was tested in 1.19.4
- This is meant to be a remote furnace array so there is no Good UI for it
- The honey Can be replaced with slime blocks for the rising edges and an ender chest for the Box loader
- Tested for only 2 million items in each mode
