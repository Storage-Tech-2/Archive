Hybrid hall containing a composter based hybrid box loader that allows for accessing items being loaded in boxes without a call feature.
## Features
- Fully hopperlocked
- 2 x 212.5k items in bulk, and another 4.7k in loose items, per slice.
- Composter based hybrid loader with reliable box collection
- SS2 independent filters
- compact, AB tiled, filters are ABCD tiled, AB tiled for v3.1W
- low hopper count (28, 14 per half slice)
- global box placement
## Considerations
- 6 stack buffer(with shulkerboxes in hopper pointing into shulker. included in shematic)
- hopperlocking must be activated in a specific order(this is already prepared in the prebuilt version)
- a lot of composter prefill(v3.1W does not have as much)
- UI may be a little cramped for some(does not apply to v3.1W)
- requires a lot of attention to detail for the tiling
