  "definition": "A cart yeeter is a device which breaks a cart with an inventory, emptying its contents in item entity form. The cart item is also collected separately for recycling. Cart yeeting was introduced in 1.19, before which hoppercarts/chestcarts dropped the cart separately from the hopper/chest, making it impossible to recycle them automatically.\n\n## Mechanics\nWhen a cart is broken, the contents of the cart drops first, the cart item drops afterwards. The cart item however, drops with a slightly different position and momentum, allowing for them to be separated with clever alignment techniques  [video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhY2mIdV7NM).\n\nNote that the contents of a cart can become fragmented, with full stacks breaking up into smaller ones randomly. Perfect merge yeeters such as CT001 can reliably merge the fragments with special timings. \n\n### Details\nLet xm, ym, zm equal the minecart entity position, and w be the width of the item (0.25F)\n\nThe contents of the cart will drop [[see code]](https://mcsrc.dev/#1/1.21.11_unobfuscated/net/minecraft/world/Containers):\n- at: x = floor(xm) + random([0, 1]) x (1 - w) + w/2\n- at: y = floor(ym) + random([0, 1]) x (1 - w)\n- at: z = floor(zm) + random([0, 1]) x (1 - w) + w/2\n- Random vertical momentum `triangular(mode: 0.2, deviation: 0.11485000171139836)`\n- Random x and z momentum `triangular(mode: 0.0, deviation: 0.11485000171139836)`\n\nThe minecart item will drop [[see code]](https://mcsrc.dev/#1/1.21.11_unobfuscated/net/minecraft/world/entity/Entity#L2140-2149):\n- at exactly xm, ym, zm\n- fixed vertical momentum of 0.2\n- Random x and z momentum U[-0.1, 0.1]",
