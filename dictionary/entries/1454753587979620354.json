  "definition": "A contraption that makes no use of redstone dust. Redstone dust is one of the single most laggiest components in the game, since it gives 25 updates for each ss(Signal Strength) change. When increasing signal, it updates one for each increase level, so going from ss 3 to 7, for instance would give 100 block updates. Decreasing signal is different between versions 1.14- and 1.15+, where in the former it happens the same way it does when increasing values, and in the latter, it moves by steps of two, reducing the amount of updates by half. In 1.15+ dust dots (single dust) update all at once, without stepping through intermediary ss values. A big part of the community also calls Dust updateless contraptions Dustless, since the updates is the only part of the dust that lags.",
