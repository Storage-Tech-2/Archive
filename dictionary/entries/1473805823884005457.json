  "definition": "A grouper is a variable box sorting device, which checks if a box contains a specific item type anywhere in the box. This is similar to a box matcher, but instead of having a fixed filter which is set when you build it, the filter in a grouper can be automatically set and reset based on the boxes you input.",
