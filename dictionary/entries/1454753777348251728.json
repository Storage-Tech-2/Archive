    "Pistonless"
  ],
  "definition": "A contraption that makes no use of pistons. This is to reduce client-side lag(fps) due to tile entities in 1.16+ and general server-side lag, since each piston has to check all the Tile Entities(Tile Entity) in the world each time it tries to extend, and storage systems tend to have a lot of TEs. This effect is partly mitigated in 1.17+ and greatly mitigated by the Lithium mod.",
