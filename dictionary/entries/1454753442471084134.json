  "definition": "It aligns items within a block to ensure some sort of behavior. More basic concepts involve simply letting items in a water or ice stream hit against a block with a certain hitbox, while more complex ones involve precisely timed contraptions, see Perfect aligner. The more simple use cases involve using a chest, dragon egg, 2 or 3 stack of pickles, cake or some other block to align the items between two blocks such that they go over some hoppers and are inside a water stream at the same time. The use of different hitboxes allows for some more complex behaviour, where items can cycle exactly twice in a loop and then exit, or you can send many channels along one water line and have each channel exit in a different spot of the stream.",
