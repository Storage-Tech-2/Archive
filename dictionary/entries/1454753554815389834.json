  "definition": "A contraption is said to be directional if it exhibits a different behavior when rotated or mirrored.  This is usually caused by some internal component being directional itself, which in turn is most often caused by update order: each components notifies its neighbors of the update in a set order (for example, negative to positive z first, then negative to positive y, then x). There are also other causes of directionality.",
