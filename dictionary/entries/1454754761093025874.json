  "definition": "A contraption that has no moving parts or, more loosely, that has no pistons spitting blocks, or other forms of Toggle state. This term is also sometimes interchangeably used with Pistonless, although you can have a solid state contraption (in the loose way) with pistons by having them never spit out the block, i.e. powering them with long pulses only.",
