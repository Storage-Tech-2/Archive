  "definition": "Perfect item aligner refers to a contraption that aligns items in all three axes before sending them down a stream, where they usually get picked up by hoppers. Since these contraptions are usually ran at Hopper speed,  the items need to have a perfect timing between them, so that they don't reach a hopper during its cooldown stage, hence why these are also called 4D aligners (3D+time).",
