  "definition": "A code where each digit of the code has 16 possible states (usually represented as 0 to 9 and then A to F). It's most commonly implemented with signal strength values, where ss(Signal Strength) 0 represents 0, ss10 represents A, ss15 represents F and so on. Multiple hex signals can be combined to form a code with multiple digits. For example, valid three digit hex codes are 032, AFF, 0F4.",
