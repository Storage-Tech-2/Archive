  "definition": "Some contraptions are not Dustless, but the dust they use does not get updated (does not change ss(Signal Strength)). This can be because it is either used to steadily power a component, or because it's used by redirecting it, but not changing ss. Redirecting dust is really lag friendly, as lag usage goes. These terms are therefore often used interchangeably.",
