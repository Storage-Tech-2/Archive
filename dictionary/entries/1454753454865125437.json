  "definition": "An encoding where each digit of a code is either on or off (we say it has a binary state, usually represented with 0s and 1s). A four digit (Bit) signal could have the states 0000 or 0110 or 0100, or any other combination of the valid states. In terms of minecraft, this usually translates to a wire or a rail being on or off, a piston being extended or retracted, a note block being powered or unpowered, etc.",
