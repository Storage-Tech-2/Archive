  ],
  "definition": "A measurement of how many milliseconds it takes to process each gametick. If a server exceeds 50MSPT in total, then the game will slow down, as there is no longer enough time to process all 20 ticks per second(tps). MSPT is also used as a measure of how performance-intensive a contraption is by seeing how much the MSPT increases by running/loading it.",
