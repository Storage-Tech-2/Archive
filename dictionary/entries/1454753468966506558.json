  "definition": "Block event delay usually refers to piston updating other pistons in a chain reaction within a single game tick. Since pistons activate during the block event phase of the tick (kind of) and things execute in the order they are scheduled, having something be activated by a piston that was updated by a chain of three other pistons before it (BED 3) will always happen before something that was activated by a BED 5 event.",
