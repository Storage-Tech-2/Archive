  "definition": "A bucket is a container, typically holding a specific subset of items. Buckets are used to fragment large bodies of information into callable and searchable subsets to speed up a search process by reducing the number of calls that need to be made to confirm no match exists.\n\nOne place the term appears regularly is with regard to temp storages, where a box being input needs to check for a match somewhere in the systems. buckets are used to reduce search operations, by only checking a small group of boxes that are stored, as compared to checking every box.",
