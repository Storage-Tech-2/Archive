  "definition": "A Comparator Update Detector is based on the behavior inherent to comparators where they don't notice inventory changes when reading it through a solid block (including an inventory being moved away or put in place, like a composter being moved by a piston). The CUD will then change it's signal once it either receives a block or inventory update. See [`updateNeighbourForOutputSignal`](https://mcsrc.dev/#1/1.21.11_unobfuscated/net/minecraft/world/level/Level#L992-1008).\n\n## Special behaviors\n- Brewing stand: Sends a comparator update when consuming fuel, brewing begins, and when brewing progresses. See calls to [`BlockEntity.setChanged()`](https://mcsrc.dev/#1/1.21.11_unobfuscated/net/minecraft/world/level/block/entity/BlockEntity#L208-219) in [`BrewingStandBlockEntity.serverTick()`](https://mcsrc.dev/#1/1.21.11_unobfuscated/net/minecraft/world/level/block/entity/BrewingStandBlockEntity#L98-122)\n- Detector rail: Sends a comparator update every tick when an entity is colliding with it. See calls to [`ServerLevel.updateNeighbourForOutputSignal()` in `DetectorRailBlock.tick()`](https://mcsrc.dev/#1/1.21.11_unobfuscated/net/minecraft/world/level/block/DetectorRailBlock#L82-115)",
