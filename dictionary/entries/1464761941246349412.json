  "definition": "A restock station is a simple device which displays shulker boxes of useful items for the player to take items from. It's called a restock station because it allows the player to restock on food, fireworks, ender pearls, totems and other essential survival items. They are typically made with a wall box display with chests for manual refilling. The box display automatically replaces the box with a full one if emptied by the player.",
