    "Update order"
  ],
  "definition": "Update order is the order in which Minecraft will process actions. Because Minecraft is a software program, actions that appear to occur simultaneously must occur sequentially one after another in some way. For designs using redstone which activates on the same tick, the behavior of a circuit depends on which activates first, in other words, update order.\n\n## Details\n- The default update order is West, East, Down, Up, North, South. See [`NeighborUpdater.UPDATE_ORDER`](https://mcsrc.dev/1/1.21.11_unobfuscated/net/minecraft/world/level/redstone/NeighborUpdater#L20).\n- Redstone dust has random/locational redstone update order, but deterministic shape updates. So powering something with dust will have locational order (avoid!!), but observing a dust wire with an observer will have consistent source to sink order (fine).\n- Powered and activator rails have directional redstone update order, it is source to sink in the north-south axis, and is sink to source in the east-west axis. Shape updates are consistently sink to source (opposite of dust).\n- Pistons have block event delay, which means adding a piston to logic will often mean the next thing the piston triggers will update last.\n- Repeaters and comparators have different tile tick priority depending on the block it is pointed to.",
