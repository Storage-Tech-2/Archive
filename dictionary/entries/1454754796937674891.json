  "definition": "Refers to the phenomenon where short pulsing a comparator for 2gt only causes it to activate if it is pointing into another comparator or repeater block.\n\n## Details\nThe block ticking list is a [priority queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue) which prioritizes processing higher priority entries over lower ones. While both comparators and repeater blocks are considered to be diode blocks, they have different priorities assigned to them.\n\nFor comparators: tick priority is HIGH if there is another diode block it's pointing into and it's not pointing backwards. Otherwise, it has NORMAL priority. See [`ComparatorBlock.checkTickOnNeighbor()`](https://mcsrc.dev/#1/1.21.11_unobfuscated/net/minecraft/world/level/block/ComparatorBlock#L151).\n\nFor repeaters: tick priority is EXTREMELY_HIGH if there is another diode block it's pointing into and it's not pointing backwards. Otherwise, if powered it has VERY_HIGH priority. If unpowered it has HIGH priority. See [`DiodeBlock.checkTickOnNeighbor()`](https://mcsrc.dev/#1/1.21.11_unobfuscated/net/minecraft/world/level/block/DiodeBlock#L102-112).",
